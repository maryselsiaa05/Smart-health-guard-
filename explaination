What this example uses (common setup)

Microcontroller: ESP32

Heart & SpO₂: MAX30102 (or MAX30105)

Temp/Humidity: DHT11 (swap to DHT22 if you have it)

Motion / fall detection: MPU6050 (accelerometer)

Cloud: ThingSpeak (easy HTTP POST) — replace with Blynk/Firebase later if you prefer

Libraries to install (Arduino IDE -> Manage Libraries)

SparkFun MAX3010x (or search for MAX30105) — SparkFun library that provides raw reading and examples.

DHT sensor library (by Adafruit)

MPU6050 (Jeff Rowberg or MPU6050_light — any commonly used)

ThingSpeak (optional) or use HTTPClient (we use HTTPClient in code, so ThingSpeak lib not required)

And built-in: WiFi.h, Wire.h, HTTPClient.h

Wiring (summary)

MAX30102: VCC → 3.3V, GND → GND, SDA → GPIO21 (ESP32), SCL → GPIO22

DHT11: VCC → 3.3V (or 5V depending on module), GND → GND, DATA → GPIO4 (example)

MPU6050: VCC → 3.3V (or 5V per module), GND → GND, SDA → GPIO21, SCL → GPIO22
(If MAX30102 and MPU6050 share I²C pins, that's fine — both on same bus)
