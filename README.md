# Smart-health-guard-
An IoT-based health monitoring and safety system for real-time patient tracking.
🩺 Smart Health Guard

Smart Health Guard is an IoT-based health monitoring and safety system designed to continuously track vital health parameters and alert users or caretakers in case of abnormalities. The project aims to bridge healthcare and technology, making real-time monitoring accessible, reliable, and portable.

🚀 Project Overview

Smart Health Guard uses a combination of sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless communication to collect, process, and transmit health data such as heart rate, body temperature, oxygen level, and motion activity.
The system ensures continuous tracking and provides instant alerts in emergency situations. It’s designed to assist patients, elderly individuals, and remote healthcare monitoring systems.

💡 Key Features

🔹 Real-time Monitoring – Tracks vital signs like heart rate, SpO₂, temperature, and motion.

🔹 Emergency Alerts – Sends instant notifications when abnormal readings are detected.

🔹 IoT Dashboard – Displays live health data through an online platform or mobile app.

🔹 Wearable and Portable Design – Compact and easy to carry for continuous monitoring.

🔹 Cloud Connectivity – Data stored securely for doctor access and analysis.

🔹 Battery Efficient – Optimized power usage for extended operation.
